# Webpack-basics
Small project to understand what Webpack is and does exactly.

Two JS files were created. One that expeorts the other importing and everything is built with webpack. 

A dist folder is created with the compiled code. I learned, at a high level, what is being bundled and the pruspoe of webpack.
